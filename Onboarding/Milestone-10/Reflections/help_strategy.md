# When do you prefer using AI vs. searching Google?

- To explain concepts I don't understand. For example, how do these two classes interact with each other to produce this output?
- I use it to teach me foundational concepts and to quiz me to check my understanding.
- I also use it for syntax checking. I find it is much faster in finding errors in my code than myself.
- I use google if the answers LLM's give me don't make sense and or reading official documentation would get me to the answer faster.

# How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?

- If the output an LLM is giving me is nonsensical.
- If I have exhausted all other options and I still can't get to the answer myself
- If it is a design decision that requires context from others that an LLM could not ascertain itself.
- If the question involves sensitive user data. E.g. database encryption and or how to manage these keys.

# What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?

- Too many conflicting solutions online. Which one do you choose and how do you integrate it into your codebase?
- Constantly missing the obvious solution as you are frustrated/fatigued.
- Contextually Ai doesn't know that the reason a feature you are trying to implement is because of a rule/class/function created earlier in the codebase is overwriting the output of your current function and or causing bugs in your software.
- Spending a significant amount of time attempting to solve the problem when being shadowed by a senior developer could fix the issue quickly.
- Issues with confidence may lead to burnout and or a general lack of motivation to solve a complex problems. This may further spiral into becoming overwhelmed with the codebase if issues continue to pile up, leading to further burnout, lack of productivity and as such reinforcing the cycle.
