# How do these rles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?

- Dev
-- Kanban: work based on Kanban tasks on board
-- Scrum: work based on overall sprint goal that must be met, inform team via daily standups


- QA
-- Kanban: Test as soon as code is ready
-- Scrum: Test once sprint has been completed

- PM
-- Kanban: Manage Kanban board flow and task backlog based on context of project and requirements thats must be met
-- Scrum: Creates sprint backlog based on what must be done

-Agile PM
-- Kanban: Like PM, also manages Kanban board flow, aids in blocker removal
-- Scrum: Runs scrum meetings, removes blockers

- Supporting roles
-- Kanban: Can aid in updating Kanban board or giving feedback via tickets
-- Scrum: Possibly attend daily standups to give feedback


# What is my role and how does it contribute to the Agile process?
- As a backend developed I am mainly working on tasks from the Kanban board and attending standups to update the team on the work compelted and any blockers I may have


# Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.
As a developer I take user/technical requirements and integrate them into software. I also must ensure a high standard of quality is apparent in my code and that it is well documented should others need to modify/update it.  


# Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.
- I would frequently collaborate with the product manager to make sure what I am working on aligns with their expectations of the feature/product. This will mainly be through daily standups.
