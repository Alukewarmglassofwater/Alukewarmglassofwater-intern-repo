**Research & Learn**

- Who are considered vulnerable populations, and what challenges might they face in digital spaces?  
-- People that are at risk due to factors and circumstances out of their control compared to the mean population.

- What ethical considerations are important when designing or working with neurodivergent individuals?  
  (Hint: Avoid overwhelming UX, respect sensory needs, ensure clear communication.)
-- Respect requirements that may seem unusual or strange to a neurotypical individual. Make sure to communicate in a clear manner so nothing is assumed between the two parties.

- How can you make interactions and content more accessible for people with ADHD or Autism?  
  (e.g., simple language, predictable navigation, reducing cognitive load)  
-- Clear and intiuitive UI design. Possibly reduce the amount of objects on screen/Keep design langauge simple and minimal as to ensure individual isn't overwhelmed. 

- How can we support neurodivergent team members in a professional setting?  
  (Hint: Be clear in communication, respect different working styles, and allow flexibility.)
-- Accomodate for the differences between individuals and understand that social quirks exhibited by these individuals do not exude the same meaning as what would be seen in a neurotypical interaction. E.g. Being direct does not mean they are annoyed at you, simply how they communicate best.


**Reflection**

- How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?  
-- Communicate as per normal. However, if asked to change my style I will acommodate for them. I could possibly ask individuals if they have any requirements they'd like me to accomodate or be make know of so I am able to best suit their needs.

- What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?  
-- Unintuitive cluttered interface. Difficult application navigation. Overwhelming functionality/options to choose from. Written in such a way that is not clear. E.g. Makes use of sarcasm or neurotypical behaviours that would not make sense to a neurodivergent individual. 

- What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?
-- Research the requirements of neurodivergent individuals and make sure to integrate them into my work. E.g. Use plain concise language in UI elements.

**Task**

- Read a first-person account from someone with ADHD or Autism about their experiences with productivity tools.  
  (Hint: Look for blog posts, videos, or community discussions.)

- Identify one design or communication improvement that could make Focus Bear more accessible.  
-- Audible alerts that coincide with on-screen notifications.

- Practice writing a clear, patient, and supportive response to a hypothetical user struggling with executive functioning.
-- Hi there, I understand you are having difficulty starting a task? It's completely ok to be overwhelmed at beginning X, I for one get overwhelmed all the time :). However, I find that breaking up the task into smaller, easily achievalbe tasks helps greatly in getting the motivation to continue through it. Maybe that is something you can try? If it doesn't work email me back and we can go through other options together.
