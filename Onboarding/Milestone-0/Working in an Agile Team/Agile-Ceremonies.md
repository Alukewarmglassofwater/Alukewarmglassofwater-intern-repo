**Research & Learn**

- What are the main Agile ceremonies, and what is their purpose?
  - Daily Stand-ups
    -- Collaborative feedback on where team members are in their work. If they have any blockers, and, if required, ask for help from other members.

  - Sprint Planning (Scrum) vs. Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)
    -- Sprint planning is where a team will select what needs to be completed in the upcoming sprint and what they need to do to achieve it. Continuous Prioritization however is where tasks are mapped to priority levels in how necessary they are to be completed. This is a continuous processes that occurs throughout the project cycle. Possibly can be done in a weekly retro?

  - Retrospectives  
    -- Held at the end of an event such as a scrum sprint where reflection takes place. It highlights what went well and what can be improved going forward.

  - Backlog Refinement  
    -- Project manager reviews what is in the current Kanban backlog and aligns them with what the requirements are of the project. If tasks are aligned then nothing needs to be done. If they are not aligned then tasks will be culled and replaced with new Kanban tasks that more closely reflect the project goals.

- How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?
  -- Project management tools such as Monday and Trello can be used to assign tasks as well as chatrooms such as Slack/Microsoft Teams as to foster communication. Furthermore, teams could be grouped via time zones and work assigned accordingly.

**Reflection**

- How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?
  -- They foster open communication and allow for periods of reflection to better align the project tasks with what is required from the stakeholders of the project.

- Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?
  -- Daily standups will be the most important for my role as they are where I will be able to ask for help with blockers I run into while working on my tasks. Furthermore, they also will allow team members to re-direct my approach to a particular problem if I am going down the wrong path.

**Task**

### Attend a stand-up meeting and observe how updates are shared.

- I have been attending stand up meetings at 4pm every Tuesday and Thursday (scheduled internship working days). These standups are held on google meet and everyone reports what they completed, any blockers they a running in to, of which advice will be given by Jeremy (the founder) and or other members. These meetings are very short and only last for ~10 minutes max.

### Participate in a retrospective or review past notes from one.

- Viewed a retro board in a standup and observed how the board was laid out as well as what went well and what went wrong.

### Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.

- I can provide more timely updates about what I am working on and any issues I may have by making use of the team discord more. By communicating in this way I can remove blockers faster and prevent becoming overwhelmed with a particular task.
