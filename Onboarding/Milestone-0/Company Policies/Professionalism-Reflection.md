**Research & Learn**

- What are examples of professional vs. unprofessional behaviour in a casual work environment?  
  (Hint: Think about communication, meeting etiquette, and teamwork.)  
-- Professional: Attending meetings ontime, communication if you cannot attend. Being respectful in meetings. Not raising your voice if you have an opinion that differs from another team member.
-- Unprofessional: Not attending meetings. Not communication with team members. Responding in a rude manner to others. Failing to communicate blockers with others. 

- What does respectful communication look like in remote teams?  
  (e.g., tone in messages, handling disagreements, responding to feedback)  
-- Polite and professional tone in all circumstances. The ability to handle criticism and give feedback in a manner that does not involve personally attacking the other party. Focus on behaviours and knowledge gaps vs highlighting flaws in personal traits. 

- How can you give and receive feedback professionally?  
  (e.g., focus on actions, not people; assume good intent; ask for clarification instead of reacting defensively)  
-- Rather than divulging insults, it is more effective to encourage professional growth and to frame your feedback in a manner that contributes to that. When receiving assume this is the same for your own feedback and frame it that it is for your benefit only and nothing more.

**Reflection**

- Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?  
-- I worked at a franchise whom I later found out was mis-treating my manager. Given the stress he was under it was remarkable he was able to keep his professionalism and composure when working with us and dealing with frustrated customers. His ability to remain calm and professional at all times ensures we were able to perform as well as we did and not let poor upper management effect the operations of his team. 

- What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?  
-- Use direct langauge that has a professional tone. Make sure to clarify intent in messages to ensure they are not mis-interpreted by the enduser if asynchronous. Listen intently and avoid making assumptions. Try to view the issue from the perspective of the other person to ensure you understand where they are coming from. 

- How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?  
-- Bring a positive attitude to work. Always be ready to listen and help others. Do not judge and answer any question, regardless of how simple it is, as the only stupid questions are the ones not asked. Be mindful of the boundaries of others but attempt to keep the workplace light and fun. 

- How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?  
-- Bring notes on what you would like to discuss. Dress appropriately and minimise distractions to show you are directly focused on the other individuals.

- What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?  
-- Ask questions, ask for help when needed and seek out other opportunities that go beyound the internship. E.g. FocusBear events and or go above and beyond the work assigned to you. 

- How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them?  
-- I would message them on the corporate messaging platform. If they do not reply I will send a reminder message. If they do not respond again I will send a message informaing them to call me when they find convenient to discuss the topic. 

-How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?  
-- I would escalate after a week from when I sent the original message. If I get a response back indiciating that they are busy then of course I won't escalate. 

- What are some things you won't do?
--Personally attack the individual and or revert to name-calling/insults.
