# User Manual for Jackson Golz

## My Role

- I am working on backend developer tasks. I want to make it clear that I am not a developer by trade and have only completed three semesters of light programming experience. I sought out this internship after recognizing that my coding skills were lacking and hope to improve upon them as a result.  
- The days and times I work are **Tuesday** and **Thursday**. I prefer to work early in the morning so I have my evenings to unwind.

## How I Work Best

- I do my best work when I am left alone with minimal interruptions. I find that time pressure and upcoming deadlines help motivate me.

---

## Communication Style

- I prefer messages to be detailed and direct.  
- The best way to reach me is via **Signal messenger** or **Teams**. I may take longer to respond on other platforms.

## Collaboration & Teamwork

- I work best in a team when tasks are clearly **delegated**.  
- My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is when team members do not put in the same amount of effort as I do.  
- If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means I’m stuck on an issue that I’m not sure how to resolve.

---

## Focus & Productivity

- I stay focused by listening to music through headphones. I work best when I am alone and can control my environment — e.g. heating, lighting, noise levels, etc.
- Things that distract me include anything unexpected in my workspace. I also tend to procrastinate when avoiding difficult tasks, which in itself becomes a distraction.
- The best way to support my productivity is to give me **clearly outlined tasks** that are reasonable to achieve within the given timeframe.

---

## Feedback & Growth

- I like feedback to be direct and include examples of how I can improve.  
- When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is **immediately**, either via a phone call or a direct message.  
- I appreciate when teammates openly communicate their issues and give constructive feedback on my work.

## Fun Facts & Quirks

- A fun fact about me is that I’m really into **bikes and technology**.
