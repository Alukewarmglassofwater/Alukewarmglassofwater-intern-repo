# Task

## Adjust your laptop setup based on ergonomic best practices.
- Done

## Identify at least one piece of equipment that could improve your posture and comfort.
- Footrest. Currently do not have one.

## Try using posture and movement reminders for a full workday and note any improvements. (Hint: # Focus Bear has built-in reminders for movement breaks!)
- Did today and it worked well to keep me fresh and alert.

## Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made.
- Adjusted monitor heights and chair to be more ergonomic. Makes interacting with my machine more straightforward and takes the straight off my neck and back. Making it easier to conduct longer work sessions.
