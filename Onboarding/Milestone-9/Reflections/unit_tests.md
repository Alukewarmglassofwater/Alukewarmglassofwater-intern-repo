## Why is automated testing important in software development?

- Unit testing is important as it allows for code edge cases to be caught before they occur in production.
- Automated testing via jest allows new code to be tested to ensure it is able to provide a base standard of functionality.
- Ensures that previously working code doesn't fail if functionality of the codebase is expanded.
- Also test files can be seen as documentation that outlines how functions and code is expected to behave.

## What did you find challenging when writing your first Jest test?

- I am having a difficult time remembering Jest syntax and how the tests actually work. The Jest framework is so streamlined it is difficult to understand what is actually happening under the hood. E.g. the expect() service must run the service, parse in specified values then check the return against a specified output. The more I play with the framework the more it makes sense however at a first glance it appeared unintuitive.
