### AI Tools Reflection

**Which AI tools did you try?**  
ChatGPT

**What worked well? What didn’t?**  
I've used ChatGPT throughout my uni experience to help with programming. It works well for generating boilerplate code and explaining syntax or concepts I haven't encountered before.  
However, when complex logic is required, AI tools tend to fall apart, often producing hallucinations that sound correct but don’t actually solve the problem.

**When do you think AI is most useful for coding?**  
- Generating boilerplate code  
- Learning programming basics  
- Quizzing yourself on fundamental concepts  
- Identifying syntax errors
