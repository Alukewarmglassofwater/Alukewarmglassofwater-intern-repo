### DevTools & Extensions Reflection

**Which extensions did you install? Why?**  
I installed the following browser extensions as I was instructed to do so:
- **React Developer Tools** – to inspect React components
- **Redux DevTools** – to debug Redux state (Library for global state management)
- **A JSON Viewer** – Shows JSON data sent between client -> API and back
- **Lighthouse** – for performance auditing of web apps

**What was the most useful thing you learned?**  
I didn’t explore them deeply yet, so I haven’t learned anything specific. However, didn't realise quality-of-life extensions such as these existed. It is nice to be able to view JSON data without have to print it to a dev console everytime.
