# Which shortcuts do you think will be the most useful in your daily work?

- I think the multi-line shortcute, remove unused imports and toggle line comments for debugging will be the most useful as they allow for faster editing/decrease tedium when working in VSCode .

- Keyboard shortcuts reduce the need to constantly switch between mouse and keyboard, allowing you to work more efficiently. Same philosophy behind the vim editor. Shortcute save time on repetitive tasks, help you stay focused, and allow for faster navigation and editing within the codebase.
