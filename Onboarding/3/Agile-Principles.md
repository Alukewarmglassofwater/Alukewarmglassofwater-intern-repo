# Summarize the main differences of Scrum and Kanban in your own words:

### Scrum
- Scrum is the framework that breaks down project goals into sprints. After each sprint, feedback is given and, if required, used to improve the next sprint and or change the goals of the project. An advantage of scrum is the continous feedback acheived via these sprints. 
- Used when project has clear goals that can easily map to team sprints. 

-- Has a scrum master
-- Daily standups take place (~15 minutes)



### Kanban
- Unlike scrum, a kanban board is used that breaks down project tasks into kanban cards. These cards move across a kanban board, ending in completing of the task. It allows teammembers real-time visual feedback on the status of the project and what needs to be done. It also allows all team members to enact change if so required.
- Used when project development does not have clear goals, more so evolves naturally by the efforts of its members rather than orders from management.

- Backlog -> Today -> Doing -> Blocked -> Done

# Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.

### "The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face converstation"

- I chose this principle as for me I belive I will get the most out of physically interacting with team members is what will identify the mistakes in my work and bring out the best in my abilities.

Notes:

#### What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?

- Umbrella term for a methodology of working that is incremental and reflective rather than traditional linear frameworks. This allows the project to be literally agile in the sense, goals and objectives can be modified after each sprint, allowing the project to more closely align to the goals of the client.

#### What are the core values and principles of Agile? (Hint: Check the Agile Manifesto.)

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan


#### Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?
- FocusBear operates with a small team. As a result, the freedom Kanban offers compared to a more structured Scrum allows team members to contribute to the project and have ownership over their work. The diversity all members bring allows for further feature development rather than being limited to the vision of a single stakeholder.
