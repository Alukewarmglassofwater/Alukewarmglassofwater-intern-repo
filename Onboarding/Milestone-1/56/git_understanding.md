 Merge Conflict Reflection

1. **What caused the conflict?**  
- I created a branch called conflict-branch-
- Created a file called testfile.md, wrote some text and saved.
- Changed to the main branch and edited the same file but wrote different text on the same line.
- I then attempted to merge the conflict-branch with main which resulted in a merge conflict.

2. **How did you resolve it?**  
- To resolve it I manually chose what text I wanted to keep, removed the merge conflict markers and saved the file. To mark as resolved I commited the file again and then pushed it to my repo. 

3. **What did you learn?**  
- How to resolve merge conflicts and how branching in git works.
