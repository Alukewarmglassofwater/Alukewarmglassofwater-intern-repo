 Internship Goals Reflection

1. **What do you hope to learn from this internship?**  
- I hope to gain experience in backend development and reach one of my bucket list goals of finally becoming a semi-proficient programmer. The ability to actually contribute to a real production code base, something beyond the scope of small uni scripting assignments, is incredibly exciting to me. Furthermore, I started my journey in technology with the motivation that I simply wanted a more in-depth understanding of computer systems and how they function. This internship is a step towards that. 

2. **What skills are you most excited to develop?**  
- I am excited to write javascript/typescrypt and for it to become intutive overtime. No more constantly googling syntax or stealing other peoples code from stack overflow. The code I write will come straight from me and to be able to have onus on software that helps fix a problem that I am passionate in makes it all the more easy to persue.

3. **What do you think you can contribute to the team?**  
- To be honest, my programming background is basic at best. Javascript was introduced to me at the beginning of my masters in a basic web development unit and even so we only spent ~2 weeks on it. I am a naturally distraction-prone individual and everytime I sit down to write software I would find an excuse/distraction to take me away from putting the effort in to persue it. The internship is an effort to change that. I feel that I communicate well, work hard and, while not naturally gifted in programming, have the ability to hold my nose against the grindstone even if no solution seems apparent. Learn't that the hard way in my Semester 3 Assembly course. 

4. **What is one area you feel less confident in that youâ€™d like to improve?**  
- I am not confident at all writing software. I have very little experience in it let alone working with web development frameworks. If I can get to the point where I am able to truly write my own code that fixes a problem with the FocusBear's backend codebase and have that code merged into production I can say my masters degree was worth it. 

5. **What does success in this internship look like for you?**  
- Success would be members of the team forgetting I am an intern.
