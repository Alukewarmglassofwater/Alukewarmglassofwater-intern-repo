Competitive Analysis Reflection

1. **What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?**

- Focus bear is attempting to be the Microsoft Outlook of productivity apps. That is it is a piece of software which attempts to do everything that is required to eleminate distraction and keep a neurodivergent/distraction prone individual on task. It does distraction blocking via AI, keeps a persistent notepad for the user to dump their thoughts into, instructs the user to keep daily habits as well as synchronise this data across multiple devices.

2. **If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?**

- I would choose it as it specifically caters to neurodivergent individuals. Furthermore, I appreciate the transparency that FocusBear displays from the get-go with the note from the founder as well as in-depth FAQs on how FocusBear stores user data/their privacy policy. Furthermore, it seems, unlike other productivity apps that cater to neurodivergent indivuals (Tiimo) that if the user is in a state where they can't follow the FocusBear schedule, their is abundant opportunity to either disable FocusBear and or delay notification/habits so the application can better fit into the user's workday. This makes the application easier to keep running in the background and the user less prone to uninstall it for it being too invasive.

3. **What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?**

- Tiimo has calendar integration. Furthermore, it can also be used with the web application offering more flexibility to the user. Routinery has location-based routines however this seems more of a gimmick than a useful feature.

4. **Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?**

- Calendar integration would mean I can move my workflow from Google Calendar into FocusBear, making it that much more crucial to my everyday life and therefore increasing my use of the application. Possibly if FocusBear also had a journaling function I could further integrate it into my workflow as it would replace Microsoft OneNote for my university/general note taking.
