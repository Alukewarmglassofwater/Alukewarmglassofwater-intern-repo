Reflection Questions

1. **Why do you think Focus Bear was created?**  
- Focus bear was created to solve a problem that current productivity apps fail to solve. That is to be an all encompassing solution to aid neurodivergent individuals in focusing and completing the tasks that they set out to do.


2. **What problem is Focus Bear solving?**  
- Focus bear gently nudges the user towards working on their required tasks by blocking distracting website/distractions in general. It also reminds the user to undergo healthy habits, such as drinking water and or following the 20 20 20 rule, as to maximise their productivity and minimise the reoccuring trend of letting these habits fall to the wayside in favour of  'deep working' on their tasks. 

3. **Why do you think this mission is important?**  
- I think it is important as I have also been in the situation where I let distractions take my attention away from what I should be completing. Furthermore, my partner's mother is neurodivergent and I see what she struggles with day to day. As a result I feel I am closely alligned to the mission of FocusBear.

4. **How does Focus Bearâ€™s work align with your personal values or interests?**  
- As previously mentioned I have neurodivergent individuals in my life (and possible might be myself based on past behaviour) and understand that life is indeed more difficult for someone where your environment doesn't cater to your needs. FocusBear's mission is to help alleviate some of this burden on neurodivergent individuals and improve their quality of life and it is a mission that I would be more than happy to contribute too. 

5. **Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?**  
- I do. I have may interests that I have not followed due to distraction/anxiety. Often I cope via methods that take away the feeling on the short term but offer no progression to what I am truely interested in. I have already found that using FocusBear to manage my desktop environment and remind me to perform my daily habits does truely help in getting what I need to get done done.
