**Research & Learn**

- How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?
-- Project tasks are broken up into Kanban cards. As tasks progression occurs they move from left to right across the Kanban board eventually reaching done. 

- What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent? (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)
-- The different collumns represent different stages of the Kanban tasks progress from start to finish. Blocked tasks are tasks that cannot be completed due to an issue thatmust be fixed before the tasks can be worked on.

- How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?
-- Tasks move through the board from left to right. The individuals working on the tasks update the task progress by moving the tasks from collumn to collumn. The backlog is normally updated by the project manager. 

- What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?
-- WIP limits make bottleneck and blockers more visibile as they aren't hidden behind a mountain of tasks that may make the bottleneck less obvious. Also reduces overhead found in constant task switching. 


**Reflection**

- How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
-- It assigns singular tasks to an individual and has a strict limit on how many tasks and indivudal can work on at a given time. If a blocker occurs then the task is shelved and another tasks is worked on until the blocker is resolved. As a result priorities are manager and overload is avoided.

- How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
--  I will limit myself to singular tasks and only move on to another task if my initial task is completed. Furthermore, I will make sure to engage with my team and ask for help when I need it. If a blocker occurs I will shelve my task, move onto another and inform my project manager. 

**Task**

- Check out Focus Bearâ€™s Kanban board and note how tasks are structured. (Hint: Look in GitHub Projects.)
-- Is not populated and I am unable to edit it. Made my own board on my own repo as a result. 


- Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly.
-- See above


- Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.
-- Tasks will be regularly updated on the Kanban board as I progress through the task. Team members will be regularly updated with my progress during daily standups.
